### Prerequisites

Before installing Geyser and Floodgate on your Minecraft server, make sure you have the following:

- A Minecraft server running on Java Edition
- Java 8 or later installed on your server
- Administrative access to your server

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the latest version of Geyser and Floodgate** from their official websites:
   - [GeyserMC Downloads](https://geysermc.org/download)

2. **Copy the downloaded Geyser and Floodgate files** to the "plugins" folder of your Minecraft server.

3. **Edit the `config.yml` file** in the "plugins/Geyser" folder to customize the server port and other settings:
   - Set `passthrough-player-counts` to `true` to enable player count syncing between Bedrock and Java editions.
   - Set `clone-remote-port` to `true` to allow Bedrock players to connect to your server using the Java Port.

4. **Restart your Minecraft server**.

5. **Players on Bedrock Edition** can now connect to your server using the server's IP address and the same port number that the Java Edition is using.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the official Geyser and Floodgate documentation for troubleshooting tips.

I hope this helps you install Geyser with Floodgate on your Minecraft server.
