title: üó∫Ô∏è Set Up a Flat World
---

1. Stop your Minecraft server.
2. Open the `server.properties` file using a text editor.
3. Look for the `level-type` property and change its value from `default` to `flat`.
4. Save and close the `server.properties` file.
5. Delete your world folder.
6. Start your Minecraft server.

Your server will now generate a new flat world when you start it up.

Optional: If you want to customize your flat world, you can modify the `generator-settings` property in the `server.properties` file. The `generator-settings` property allows you to adjust the layers and biomes of your flat world.
