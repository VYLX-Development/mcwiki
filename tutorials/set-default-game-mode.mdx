title: ðŸŽ² Set Default Game Mode
---

To set the default game mode for your Minecraft server using the `server.properties` file, follow these steps:

1. Stop your Minecraft server.
2. Open the `server.properties`
3. Look for the `gamemode` property and change its value to the game mode you want to set as default. The available game modes are `survival`, `creative`, `adventure`, and `spectator`.
4. Save and close the `server.properties` file.
5. Start your Minecraft server.

Your server will now use the specified game mode as the default game mode for new players who join.

Note: Changing the default game mode will not affect existing players' game modes.
