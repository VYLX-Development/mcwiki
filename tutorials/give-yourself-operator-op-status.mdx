title: ðŸŽ± Give Yourself Operator (OP) Status
---

1. Start your Minecraft server.
2. Log in to the server console.
3. Type the command `op <your username>` to give yourself operator status. Replace `<your username>` with your Minecraft username.
4. Press Enter to execute the command.

Your Minecraft username now has operator (OP) status on the server.

Note: Giving yourself operator (OP) status grants you access to all server commands, including potentially destructive ones. Be careful with the commands you use.
